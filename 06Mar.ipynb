The researcher may calculate the average rating of a product, the standard deviation of the ratings, and the percentage of customers who gave the product a high rating.\n",

If we want to know the most popular type of fruit, we can calculate the frequency of each category and determine which one has the highest frequency. We cannot use methods that require numerical values, such as calculating means and variances, because the categories do not have any numerical order or ranking.\n",

We can use methods such as calculating the mean, median, and standard deviation to describe the data and infer the properties of the population from the sample. We can also use methods such as regression analysis to examine the relationship between the weight of the fruit and other variables, such as the price of the fruit or the time of purchase.\n",
