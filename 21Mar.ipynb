    "The difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding lies in their application and the nature of the categorical variables they are used for:\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding: Label Encoding is a type of categorical encoding where each category is assigned a unique numerical label. The labels are typically assigned in an arbitrary manner, without any inherent order or meaning. It is commonly used when the categorical variable does not have an inherent order or when the order of the categories is not important.\n",
    "Example: Consider a dataset with a \"Size\" variable representing T-shirt sizes, with categories \"Small,\" \"Medium,\" and \"Large.\" Using label encoding, \"Small\" can be assigned label 0, \"Medium\" can be assigned label 1, and \"Large\" can be assigned label 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding: Ordinal Encoding is a type of categorical encoding where each category is assigned a numerical label based on a specified order or ranking. It is used when the categorical variable has a natural order or when the order of the categories carries meaningful information.\n",
    "Example: Suppose we have a dataset with an \"Education Level\" variable containing categories \"High School,\" \"Bachelor's Degree,\" \"Master's Degree,\" and \"PhD.\" We can assign ordinal labels to represent the increasing level of education, such as 0 for \"High School,\" 1 for \"Bachelor's Degree,\" 2 for \"Master's Degree,\" and 3 for \"PhD.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between label encoding and ordinal encoding depends on the nature of the categorical variable and the relationship between its categories. Label encoding is suitable when there is no inherent order or meaning to the categories, while ordinal encoding is appropriate when the categories have a natural order or ranking."

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique where each category of a categorical variable is assigned a numerical label based on its relationship with the target variable. The labels are assigned in an ordered manner, capturing the target-dependent information.\n",
    "\n",
    "This encoding technique is used when there is a significant correlation between the categorical variable and the target variable, and the goal is to create ordinal labels that reflect the influence of the categories on the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In a machine learning project to predict loan default, the dataset contains a \"Education Level\" variable with categories \"High School,\" \"Bachelor's Degree,\" \"Master's Degree,\" and \"PhD.\" We can calculate the default rate for each category, and based on the default rates, assign ordinal labels to represent the risk level of default. For example, if the default rates are highest for \"High School\" and lowest for \"PhD,\" the labels assigned could be 0 for \"High School,\" 1 for \"Bachelor's Degree,\" 2 for \"Master's Degree,\" and 3 for \"PhD.\"\n",
