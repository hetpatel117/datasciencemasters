    "\n",
    "* Supervised Learning: In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled data, which means that the input data is already labeled with the correct output. The goal is to learn a mapping between input data and output labels so that the algorithm can accurately predict the output for new, unseen data.\n",
    "Example: A supervised learning algorithm for image classification might be trained on a labeled dataset of images and their corresponding labels (such as cat, dog, or bird) to accurately classify new images into one of those categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unsupervised Learning: In unsupervised learning, the algorithm learns from unlabeled data, which means that the input data is not labeled with any correct output. The goal is to find patterns and structures in the data that are not immediately apparent, such as clustering or dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "Example: An unsupervised learning algorithm for customer segmentation might be used to group customers based on their purchasing behavior, without any prior knowledge of what those groups might be.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Semi-Supervised Learning: In semi-supervised learning, the algorithm learns from a combination of labeled and unlabeled data. The goal is to use the labeled data to guide the learning process and improve the accuracy of the model, while still being able to learn from the large amounts of unlabeled data available.\n",
    "Example: A semi-supervised learning algorithm for speech recognition might use a small set of labeled audio samples to learn the basic phonetic structure of the language, and then use a much larger set of unlabeled audio data to improve the accuracy of the model."

It is a subset of the original dataset that the model uses to learn the patterns and relationships between the input features and the output labels.

Without a training set, the model would not be able to learn the patterns and relationships between the input features and the output labels.\n",

Hyperparameters can significantly affect the model's performance, and choosing the right values for them can be the difference between a good and a great model.\n",
