    "Data encoding refers to the process of converting categorical or textual data into numerical representations that can be used by machine learning algorithms. It is useful in data science because many machine learning algorithms require numerical inputs. By encoding categorical data, we can include it as features in our models and utilize the information it provides."

Using nominal encoding, we can assign numerical values to represent the education levels as 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. This preserves the order information and allows the machine learning algorithm to capture the relationship between education levels and the target variable."
